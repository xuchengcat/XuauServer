"""Central filtering/validation layer for incoming vehicle telemetry models.

This module is the single place where pyBYD applies *quality filtering* to
incoming payloads before values are persisted by the state engine.

Design goals
------------
1. Keep filtering rules in one place.
2. Support both section-level and per-field filtering patterns.
3. Make extension safe and explicit, so new rules are easy to add.

Two filtering styles are used:

- **Section-level filters** (example: GPS):
    operate on the whole model because validity depends on multiple fields
    together (for example latitude + longitude).
- **Per-field filters** (example: realtime zero-dropped fields):
    operate on one field at a time and can preserve previous values when
    incoming values are missing or non-authoritative.

Execution model
---------------
- State engine calls ``apply_realtime_filters(previous, incoming)`` for
    realtime payloads and ``apply_gps_filters(previous, incoming)`` for GPS.
- A filter may keep the incoming value unchanged, or request a replacement
    (usually the last known value).
- Realtime per-field filters use a sentinel contract:
    return ``_MISSING`` to indicate "no change".

How to extend with more filters
-------------------------------
1. Add a new filter function with signature ``RealtimeFieldFilter`` when
     handling a single realtime field.
2. Register it in ``_REALTIME_FIELD_FILTERS`` under the target field name.
     Multiple filters can be chained per field; first non-``_MISSING`` wins.
3. For model-wide logic (cross-field dependencies), add/extend an
     ``apply_<section>_filters`` function that processes the full model.
4. Add regression tests for:
     - preserve previous value case,
     - accept incoming authoritative value case,
     - first payload / no-previous-value case.
